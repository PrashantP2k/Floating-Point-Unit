# Floating-Point-Unit
A project done by my while studying the Embedded Systems course at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati

In this project, I built an 8-bit Kogge-Stone adder. Using this, I built an ALU capable of doing addition, subtraction, multiplication, AND, OR, NOT and XOR between two 8-bit numbers. Using the ALU, I built a 32-bit floating point arithmetic unit (FPU) capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on two 32-bit floating point numbers.

The FPU was designed entirely in Verilog and synthesized using the [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) tool. The functionality of FPU was tested using testbenches.
